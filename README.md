## Coche - The Offline Cache for Ohloh.net data

Coche is a set of scripts written in R to access data from [ohloh.net](http://www.ohloh.net) through ohloh's [public REST API](https://github.com/blackducksw/ohloh_api) and store it in a PostgreSQL database. The output XML files can optionally be stored locally as well.
